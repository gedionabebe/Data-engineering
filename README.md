# Data-engineering
## Data engineering and warehousing using Airflow, DBT and Redash

This project will create a scalable data warehouse that will host the vehicle trajectory data extracted by
analysing footage taken by swarm drones and static roadside cameras.

The following are our subtasks:
- Create a DAG in Airflow to load the data into our database.
- Connect DBT with our database and write transformers for it.
- Connect a reporting environment and create a dashboard out of our data.
